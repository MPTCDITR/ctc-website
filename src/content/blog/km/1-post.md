# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting journey that opens up countless opportunities for creating and innovating on the internet. Whether you're looking to build a career or just want to bring your ideas to life, understanding the basics is crucial.

## The Foundation: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Every web developer starts with these three core technologies:

1. **HTML** - The structure of your content
2. **CSS** - The styling and layout
3. **JavaScript** - The interactivity and behavior

### Starting with HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any webpage. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to web development!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered the basics, you can explore:

- Frontend frameworks like React or Vue
- Backend development with Node.js
- Database management
- Version control with Git

Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Take it step by step, and you'll be building amazing things in no time!
