# Making Your Website Accessible to Everyone

Web accessibility is not just a nice-to-have feature—it's a necessity. Creating accessible websites ensures that people with disabilities can access and interact with your content effectively.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusivity**: Everyone deserves access to information
- **Legal Requirements**: Many countries require websites to be accessible
- **Better UX**: Accessible design often improves usability for all users
- **SEO Benefits**: Many accessibility practices also improve SEO

## Key Accessibility Features

### 1. Proper Heading Structure

Use headings (h1-h6) to create a logical document outline:

```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<h3>Subsection Title</h3>
```

### 2. Alt Text for Images

Always provide descriptive alt text for images:

```html
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A orange tabby cat playing with a ball of yarn" />
```

### 3. ARIA Labels

Use ARIA labels when necessary:

```html
<button aria-label="Close dialog">×</button>
```

## Testing Accessibility

- Use screen readers
- Test keyboard navigation
- Check color contrast
- Validate HTML
- Use accessibility testing tools

Remember: accessibility benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities!
