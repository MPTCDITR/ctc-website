The Community Tech Center (CTC) serves as a facility that provides digital skills training to high school students, civil servants, entrepreneurs, farmers, and local community members. The center aims to enhance digital awareness and promote the effective use of digital tools to support daily livelihoods, as well as to facilitate access to public services through online platforms.

The Community Tech Center operates through four main functional areas, including a Computer Laboratory, a Training Room, a Post Office, and a Public Hall, which also includes internet access and café services.

At present, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPTC) has constructed and put into operation a total of 21 Community Tech Centers nationwide. The Ministry also continues to develop and implement strategic plans for further expansion in order to broaden access to digital services and training across the country.
