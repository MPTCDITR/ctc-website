Phnom Penh: On the afternoon of July 22, 2025, H.E. Chea Vandeth, Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPTC), attended a dialogue with 12th-grade students at 18 Community Tech Centers (CTC) located in Takeo province, with approximately 4,000 participants, via the ZOOM video platform. The event also included the participation of H.E. the Secretary of State, as well as technical officials from the MPTC, provincial departments, the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, school directors, heads of CTC, and regular teachers from the CTC.

During this meeting, the Minister highlighted the significant achievements of the government in building and strengthening the education sector in Cambodia, as well as the contributions of the MPTC in enhancing technical education in the digital sector, which falls under the authority of the MPTC, to achieve the development of digital citizens. This includes: 1) providing 600 digital skills scholarships each year and offering interest-free financial assistance to students who pass the national high school exam with grades A, B, or C; 2) implementing the document verification system verify.gov.kh on certificates related to the national high school exam; and 3) launching the University Management System (UMS) as a priority. These activities support the implementation of the government's policy framework and strategies under the seventh mandate, led by the wise leadership and long-term vision of the Prime Minister.

Additionally, the Minister provided recommendations and guidance to the 12th-grade students to strive diligently in their studies to prepare for the upcoming exams in August, and to maintain hope in life, seek knowledge, skills, and clearly define their life direction to achieve future success. The Minister also emphasized that the key factors for each student to achieve success are based on five elements: integrity, hard work, ethics, teamwork, and seizing opportunities.

In this meeting, the Minister also provided an opportunity for students to ask questions directly, allowing him to respond to their inquiries and provide information to all participants in the meeting.

It should be noted that the CTC project at public schools is a long-term vision of the MPTC for developing digital human resources through the establishment of infrastructure to support the training of digital human resources at the grassroots level, both in schools and in the general community, to create a robust and thriving digital ecosystem. With support and collaboration from the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, the CTC project has been piloted in Takeo province, focusing on four core functions: 1) computer rooms for training in digital technology skills, providing education through distance learning, and serving as remote classrooms; 2) training rooms for providing digital technology skills training to local authorities and community citizens; 3) postal stations for receiving and sending packages, as well as providing various services to traders, entrepreneurs, and the community; and 4) public halls for community members to access information related to agriculture, business, and other information.
