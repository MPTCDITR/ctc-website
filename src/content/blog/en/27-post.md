Phnom Penh, On the afternoon of December 7, 2025, H.E. Chea Vannadet, Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, presided over the high-level closing ceremony of the Digital Government Forum, Digital Technology Exhibition, and related national and international events under the theme “Accelerating the Digital Future: Governance, Growth, and Global Partnerships.” The event was held for three days from December 5 to 7, 2025, at the Koh Pich Convention and Exhibition Center.

In his remarks, H.E. Minister Chea Vannadet stated that the 2025 Digital Government Forum and related national and international events, held over three days, provided opportunities for participants from ministries, institutions, the private sector, higher education institutions, development partners, and the general public, both national and international, to explore the latest developments in digital technologies, digital research, and innovation. This was achieved through in-depth, open-minded panel discussions and exchanges of views among sector leaders from various countries and development partners, senior officials, technical experts, and policymakers from many national and international institutions, as well as through presentations by numerous national and international speakers.

The Minister added that the outcomes of these discussions will help guide Cambodia’s digital transformation to become faster, clearer, and more effective in line with expectations, while also responding to the growing demand for digital systems among the people.

He further highlighted that what was special about the 2025 forum included:

1. The signing of seven Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with friendly countries and relevant partners in the digital sector, demonstrating Cambodia’s important role in the region.

2. The official announcement of the launch of 5G mobile services starting in 2026, and the three major mobile operators present at the exhibition provided public testing equipment to showcase the capabilities of 5G services. The Minister expressed strong confidence that 5G will significantly boost Cambodia’s economic productivity, especially in the industrial, handicraft, and service sectors, and will accelerate digital transformation across all sectors.

3. H.E. David L. Almirol Jr., Undersecretary of the Department of Information and Communications Technology of the Philippines, stated that the Philippines has deployed a digital identity verification platform (Verify) for more than 90 million citizens, with over 172 million transactions in a short period, and is preparing to integrate it into driver’s licenses in 2026.

4. Cambodia’s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications supported the initial deployment of the Verify platform for driver’s licenses in Timor-Leste.

5. Bangladesh has requested to use the Verify platform in its country, which has a population of approximately 174 million people.

6. Cambodia’s DG SuperApp platform will be introduced as part of the digital transformation process in 2026.

7. The presence of the company Plug and Play significantly increased the hopes of technology professionals and young people interested in digital startups after announcing its intention to invest in Bamnang Academy, a digital startup founded by Cambodian youth. This confirms that “Khmer can do it.” The Minister expressed hope that, with Plug and Play’s experience, Bamnang Academy will soon enter the international market.

8. The Digital Park initiative will promote job growth and transform Cambodia into a regional Digital Hub. The Ministry is committed to continuing the development of the Digital Park to ensure its success.
