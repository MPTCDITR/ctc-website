Community Tech Center Have 4 Core Functions

Takeo Province, The Community Tech Center (CTC) project in 18 public high schools is the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications’ long-term vision for developing digital human capital by providing infrastructure to support digital human resource training at the grassroots level to create an efficient, effective, and thriving digital ecosystem.

The CTC has 4 core functions: computer labs, training rooms, post offices, and public halls, which are designed to provide training in digital technology skills and provide digital services to residents in the community, especially students and the public, with the aim of promoting digital human resource training, promoting digital literacy, and reducing the digital divide in the community.

In this sense, residents living in the community will be able to participate in skilled work and learn about digital technologies such as information and communication technology, digital new business, postal services, and e-commerce.
